# Finite State Machines

This homework is about building a special kind of graph where nodes
represent machine states, and edges represent transitions between
states.

Finite State Machines are used everywhere, from text lexers and
parsers to sending and receiving data, to user interface controls like
buttons. 

## Use the tests

Like all other assignments, use the unit tests to guide your
development. Start with the first test and proceed downward---you'll
probably find that the last tests start working before you even get to
them.

## Read carefully

More than previous assignments, pay very close attention to the
documentation for each method. There's nontrivial behavior described
there.

## Use the comments-as-pseudocode

A couple of the methods are complicated, so I've left instructions as
comments in a couple of places. Use them.
